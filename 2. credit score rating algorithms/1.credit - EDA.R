# Banks decide who can get finance and on what terms and can make or break investment decisions. For markets 
# and society to function, individuals and companies need access to credit. 

# Credit scoring algorithms, which make a guess at the probability of default, are the method banks use to 
# determine whether or not a loan should be granted. This competition requires participants to improve credit scoring,
# algorithm. by predicting the probability that somebody will experience financial distress in the next two years.
