# TripType - a categorical id representing the type of shopping trip the customer made. TripType_999 is an "other" category.
# VisitNumber - an id corresponding to a single trip by a single customer
# Weekday - the weekday of the trip
# Upc - the UPC number of the product purchased
# ScanCount - the number of the given item that was purchased. A negative value indicates a product return.
# DepartmentDescription - a high-level description of the item's department
# FinelineNumber - a more refined category for each of the products, created by Walmart
